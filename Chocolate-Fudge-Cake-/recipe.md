then 3/4 cups Sugar 
and 1/4 oil 
Whisk it until the sugar is dissolved 

After that add 1 cup Flour
then some 1/3 cup or 1/4 depending on your liking cocao powder 
then add 1 teaspoon baking powder 
and 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
then whisk it all up and if the batter is too thick then pour milk accordingly if milk is unavailable water is a fine substitute.
after our done whicking the batter pour a handful of choco chips

Once the batter is ready coat your cake tin in butter or clarified butter and put a baking sheet under it to prevent the cake from sticking once thats done jsut pour your batter into the cake tin and bake on 350f or 175 celcius. the cake should be ready in 25/30 minutes. Once you think the cake is done stick a toothpick in the center and if nothing sticks on it the cake is ready if something sticks on it then it is not ready just yet.
